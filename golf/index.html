<h3>DESIGN & ENTREPRENEURSHIP</h3>

<p> <span>H</span> ow do you reinvent one of the world's most popular sports for one of the world's most reputable companies in a world that is immersed in technology? 
    For our inter-professional design and entrepreneurship project, we teamed up with Wilson Sporting Goods to research how we can bring golf to an e-commerce environment. 
    As the Covid pandemic changed the way we live pur daily lives, it became a necessity for corporations to extend their services to a virtual landscape.
</p>

<p>
    As most, if not all, golf clubs are customized and fitted to their players, we theorized an interchangeable club that can be used solely for fittings, 
    diminishing the need for in-person appointments, saving not only time but money for both parties. 
    The final project proposal and pitch to Wilson can be located below.
