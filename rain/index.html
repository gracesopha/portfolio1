<h3>INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN & SYSTEM MANAGEMENT</h3>

<p> <span>T</span> he final project for Introduction to Information Technology as a Profession. I led a group of five to create an extensive business proposal that encourages rainwater supply, an 80-year-old family-owned company, 
    to update their IT infrastructure to a modern framework. Considering their assets, needs, and goals for the future, a recommendation to break into the e-commerce atmosphere was made, along with detailed steps to achieve this movement. 
    Additionally, a budget sheet is included to supplement the choices made by our team of IT System Managers, including one-time and recurring purchases. 
    The project zip file, containing the proposal,  budget sheet and presentation, can be located below.
