<h3>AWS, DEVOPS, MARIADB, NODEJS, NGINX, PUG</h3>

<p> <span id="extraspan">M</span> y senior capstone project for the ITMT430 Systems Integration course. Using the comprehensive knowledge from all the classes taken previously, myself and my team built a three-tier web application called Hawkstagram - 
    an Instagram-inspired app for IIT students. On the frontend, we utilized NodeJS, PUG and Nginx to bring a web-based application for students at IIT to post and view others' photos. 
    As for the backend, we use MariaDB and AWS to store and retrieve our data. Additional features include Google Single-Sign-On API and full automation of deployment using Vagrant, Proxmox and Terraform on an Ubuntu server.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Throughout this course, our team worked in three-week sprints over 16 weeks to accomplish a build of three web servers, one load balancer, and a database with a cloud-based architecture. As a cybersecurity feat,
    we also implemented restricted firewall access, as well as secrets and keys through HashiCorp Vault. 
    We rotated roles of Project Manager, Lead Developer, UI/UX Developer, and IT Operations and Systems Manager to experience all types of labor in the value stream. 
    It was a challenging, yet fulfilling semester applying all my studies from my three years at IIT! Please visit the repository and documentation below!
</p>

<h1 id="subheader"> Case Study </h1>
<div class="line"></div>

<h3>CONTEXT</h3>
<p id="subheader-subtitle"> what problem are you solving? </p>
<p>
  College is lonely. It is a feeling most students are bound to experience. As students ourselves, we understand the innate human desire to connect with those around us, which led our team of four to develop Hawkstagram. 
  As the name suggests, it is primarily used as a photo-sharing app dedicated to the students at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), inspired by our school’s Scarlet Hawk and the renowned Instagram. 
  Hawkstagram allows students from the same university to share, comment, react, and connect on each other’s posts!
</p>
<br>

<p id="subheader-subtitle"> why are you solving this problem? </p>
<p>
  College is perceived to be the gateway to adulthood, often a new milestone in one’s life. People move far and wide to attend schools across the globe for their education, making it challenging to meet new people. 
  This is often a dilemma international-heavy institutions (such as IIT) face. According to Statistica in 2021-2022, nearly one million students enrolled into American universities from outside countries. These students may be in a new country for the first time on their own with the lack of resources or connections. 
  Not to mention, it is hard to meet others in general when assimilating into a new environment! Hawkstagram allows university students, particularly at IIT, to engage with one another and meet those alike and different while sharing photos and thoughts from their day. 
  <b>It is Hawkstagram’s goal to build and foster new relationships during one’s academic journey!</b>
</p>
<br>

<p id="subheader-subtitle"> what was your role? </p>
<p>
  Throughout this course, our team worked in three-week sprints over 16 weeks to accomplish a build of three web servers, one load balancer, and a database with a cloud-based architecture. 
  As a cybersecurity feat, we also implemented restricted firewall access, as well as secrets and keys through Hashicorp vault. As part of the Systems Integration project, we rotated roles of Project Manager, Lead Developer, UI/UX Developer, and IT Operations and Systems Manager to experience all types of labor in the value stream. 
  As part of our semester project, each student gave our professor a self-critique of our experiences during each role, which can be read below:
</p>
<br>
<p>
  As the Project/Scrum Master, I guided our team of four to develop a reversed-engineered web application of Instagram for IIT students created with NodeJS, PUG, Nginx, MariaDB & AWS, with automation of deployment through Terraform, Proxmox and Vagrant. 
  Specifically, I lead my team to create a three-tier architecture in addition to further development of basic CRUD functionality.
</p>
<img src="../assets/imgs/s3.png" alt="">
<img src="../assets/imgs/s3-2.png" alt="">
<p>
  As a Scrum Master, some of my responsibilities included adding items to the Kanban board, assigning story points and tasks, keeping a detailed log of progression before and after the sprint, and communicating with the stakeholder. 
  Then at the end of the sprint, I gave a presentation to our class and professor of what we had begun with, what we achieved, and what we plan to do next whilst highlighting each member’s contributions.  
</p>
<br>
<p>
  For the second sprint, I served as the IT Operations and Systems Manager to deliver automation of deployment and preserve keys. 
  With little knowledge from a previous AWS cloud computing course, it was my responsibility to deploy our environment in an automated manner. 
  My tasks are shown in the screenshot below:
</p>
<img src="../assets/imgs/s2.png" alt="">
<img src="../assets/imgs/s2-2.png" alt="">
<img src="../assets/imgs/s2-3.png" alt="">
<br>
<p>
  This was the most challenging role since the learning curve was drastic. Even so, I was able to automate a front and back end for our team! I also created a detailed tutorial to guide the next ITOS Manager. 
  According to my teammates, they said it really helped - even more than my professor! 
  As someone who is a visual learner, I made it a precedence to have detailed documentation for future reference. I am so glad it paid off!
</p>
<br>
<p>
  My next role was as UI/UX Developer, who was responsible for ensuring the application matches the wireframe and that all functionality was working as intended. 
  I was the UI/UX Dev twice – once at the beginning and at the end. 
  I created the initial wireframe to reflect Instagram’s, designed the stylesheet, and tested the webpage for bugs.
</p>
<img src="../assets/imgs/s1.png" alt="">
<img src="../assets/imgs/s4.png" alt="">
<p>
  Lastly, as Lead Developer, I was to help pre-seed all database tables with pseudo-information for both MariaDB and AWS. 
  This would occur during the automated deployment of the app, so users are greeted with our team’s posts! Since this was the final sprint, our team had put all our focus into our presentation day. 
  Instead of adding more functions like a following algorithm, we stayed true to the simplicity of a photo-sharing app. This is Hawkstagram! 
</p>

<br>


<h3>TARGET AUDIENCE</h3>
<p id="subheader-subtitle"> who is the target audience for your product? </p>
<p>
  Hawkstagram is a platform currently for IIT students with the “hawk.iit.edu” address assigned to them during enrollment. Inspired by the Scarlet Hawk mascot, our team formed Hawkstagram to bring this photo-sharing app to life. This functionality can also be repeated for other universities or industries. As noted prior, Hawkstagram is an app for any local university student wanting to engage with their community!
</p>
<br>
<p id="subheader-subtitle"> how did you learn about them? </p>
<p>
  Hawkstagram was made in mind of reverse engineering Instagram, which most individuals have these days. In fact, it’s rare to find someone without some form of social media! Therefore, our team made it our mission to make it an app for anyone at IIT to use, while maintaining the same basic functionality you can get from Instagram.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  To learn more about our target audience, we asked classmates in our Systems Integration course for feedback on items like functionality (creating, reading, updating, and deleting functions) as well as UI/UX decisions. It was a goal to mimic the school’s aesthetics down to its typeface and color scheme. Adapting to features the audience are already familiar with help with assimilating into a new application. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
  To gauge our audience’s responses, we utilized firsthand testing. By using A/B testing in early development, we were able to measure how quickly users were able to navigate frictionlessly while completing certain tasks. For this test run, we had students register, login, post, comment, then update and delete their own posts. It appeared to our team that it we should keep the “new post” feature static, like the navigation bar is, as the users would have to scroll all the way to the top to post again. By implementing this change, our users saved an average of 2-3 seconds during their test run! 
</p>
<br>
<p id="subheader-subtitle"> what key things are important to know about them? </p>
<p>
  One thing to note about Hawkstagram or any photo sharing app is that people of all demographics are interested. For that reason, the app should be streamlined and simple as much as possible. Although our app is solely for IIT students, our team still wanted to maintain the idea that it is an app that can be understood by anyone, especially if they’re familiar with Instagram’s interface. 
</p>
<br>

<h3>FINAL OUTCOME</h3>
<p id="subheader-subtitle"> what did the final design look like? </p>
<p>
  One thing to note about Hawkstagram or any photo sharing app is that people of all demographics are interested. For that reason, the app should be streamlined and simple as much as possible. Although our app is solely for IIT students, our team still wanted to maintain the idea that it is an app that can be understood by anyone, especially if they’re familiar with Instagram’s interface. 
</p>

<br>
<p>
  The final design of Hawkstagram provides increased user engagement, which fosters a sense of community among users, resulting in higher user retention rates and increased user-generated content. As mentioned, its simplicity mimics that of Instagram, making the learning threshold nonexistent. Moreover, the intuitive user interface streamlines workflows resulting in an enhanced user experience, which is easy for users to navigate, upload, and share photos effortlessly among their peers. Watch the live demo linked below!
</p>
<br>
<p id="subheader-subtitle"> what did success look like for your project? did you achieve them? </p>
<p>
  As part of our final senior capstone project, us students had a lot of leniencies in terms of what we deemed as “success”. Of course, we had multiple qualifications that must be met per sprint, such as following cloud computing principles, Google Authentication for students only, and use of Proxmox and Terraform for deployment. Other than that, our team was able to come up with the technology stack that would be approved and utilized. For this reason, we were assigned a handful of items to tackle each sprint throughout the semester.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Prior to coding, our team was tasked with decided what platforms and automation tools to use for communication and development. For updates, our team used the Discord-GitHub API to inform changes in real time for ourselves and the stakeholders. This way, there was no gap in communication or status of the project’s progression. Then, we hopped into a Discord call to discuss our tech stack, which is comprised of NodeJS, Nginx, and Pug for the frontend and MariaDB and AWS on the back. Once this was approved by our professor, our team had the greenlight to start our plans for Hawkstagram!
</p>
<br>
<p>
  As mentioned, we needed to use Google Authentication to verify the users who would have access to our site. Having SSO capabilities is somewhat of a given these days, so in leu of creating a cloud-native application, our team was required to implement this. We used OAuth 2.0 from the Google API to obtain the existing Google account and load them in as a Hawkstagram user, only permitting those with a “hawk.iit.edu” address for security measures.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Following authentication of the user, my team was finally able to work on the core of the webpage. Here we implanted basic CRUD functionality, focusing on uploading strings of text before tackling photos. This is because photos are much harder to obtain, as we’d have to dynamically query to find the images uploaded from a device. Therefore, we opted to use AWS S3, which is a Simple Storage Service offering us scalability and replication, fundamental for a cloud native application. All images can be stored and retrieved here, seamlessly fitting into our automated process. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
  To finish off the cloud-native automation process, we must replicate our webservers and create a load balancer. For our purposes, we followed the three-tier architecture consisting of three webservers, one load-balancer and database. Initially, we began with a single frontend and backend. Towards the end of the project, we added two additional webservers and a load balancer assigned to their designated MAC addresses, as given by our professor. We also introduced the HashiCorp Vault to encrypt our secrets and credentials, adding a supplementary layer of security.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Overall, success was ultimately decided by our stakeholder (professor) by sprint. Our team is happy to say that we exceeded all standards and requirements given to us throughout the semester! It was challenging and often unbearable, but we did everything we had aimed to achieve! In fact, we were the only team (out of six) that semester to achieve all requirements by sprint!
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Our final task as a team was to present our final web app to author and DevSecOps pioneer, Jeffery D. Smith, who was the guiding light, so to speak, throughout our senior capstone project. The book our class adhered by was called “Operations Anti-Patterns, DevOps Solution”, which highlights how to apply the fundamentals of Development Security Operations during the software lifecycle. As most applications are cloud-native, it was essential each team applied those modern standards into our application. So, shoutout to Jeff and his limitless knowledge that brought us to success this semester! Mr. Smith was impressed by what we did within 16 weeks, giving our team the nod of approval and humble praise. 
</p>
<br>
<p id="subheader-subtitle"> what would you do next if you had time? what did you learn? </p>
<p>
  If we had more time than the short 16 weeks given, our team had many items we’d like to improve on. To stay true to Instagram’s origin, we would’ve produced an additional mobile interface for media querying and employed more rigid coding security practices. In the future, it would be necessary to use input validation to reject any submissions that do not meet the string or image format requirements. Furthermore, our team also would have adhered to the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities for basic protection, as these are the most prevalent security issues in software.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Next, our team would have also incorporated more Instagram-like functions such as a personal page of the logged-in user’s posts, a following system, and an explore page to search other users and view popular posts. One thing that we really strived for is a following system, but time did not allow for us to implement it. Instead, we had to focus on the core features of our application (CRUD) and the automation of deployment.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  From this experience, I learned that most of my time spent “working” is time spent learning! It was in our best interest to work together and bounce ideas off one another, gradually growing our application as one. By working in programming pairs, we were able to guide one another in areas where the other felt less confident and vice versa. This fostered an environment where teammates were not fearful to ask questions or reach out for help. As a student who has preferred to work independently, this team really changed my perspective on group work! I had never had a team in my entire academic career that had the same work ethic as myself. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Even with the short time we were given and the fact our team was comprised of co-terminal (Bachelor’s and Master’s) students taking five or more classes in the semester, we are so proud of what we have achieved! From practically knowing nothing regarding automation and deployment through cloud computing strategies, our team had grown incredibly within 16 weeks! Not to mention, it was completed by the four of us remotely, all with differing schedules. Against all odds, we were able to give our all and enable one another to perform at our greatest effort. In all my educational career, I had not been a part of such an amazing, dedicated team like this one in my last semester of undergrad. I learned how important it is to be with those who encourage you to try, fail and stand back up again stronger and more knowledgeable than before.  
</p>
<br>

<h3>HIGHS & LOWS</h3>
<p id="subheader-subtitle"> what challenges did you face during your project? how did you approach those challenges? </p>
<p>
  As this project required all members of the team to rotate roles each sprint, we found it very challenging. The four of us were forced into learning new languages and software to bring our app to life over the course of 16 weeks. There was always a learning curve each time we began a new sprint, which felt a bit discouraging. All the sudden we started to get the hang of something, we were forced into a new position.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  As each team member had different experience and taken different courses, we relied on each other’s knowledge. It was a given to that the one who were assigned to Lead Developer would be pair programming with the UI/UX Developer or Developer 2 for maximum efficiency. By working together, it left less room for errors as questions were being asked and answered in real time. It also made sense for us to have the person who worked the previous role working with the person fulfilling it currently. For example, since I was the IT Operations and Systems Manager for the second sprint, I would help Aleks who was the ITOS Manager the third sprint. With the knowledge being fresh in my mind, I was able to leverage my teammates. 
</p>
<br>
<p id="subheader-subtitle"> what methods did you use to solve them? what did you learn from using those methods? </p>
<p>
  With all of us being remote, it was very necessary to talk nearly every day via Discord. We met once a week formally by the class schedule, which was only one or two hours. However, each week we’d probably have 10-15 hours of work dedicated to this single course, demanding most of our time among three to four other classes. To meet our sprint requirements, our team had to swarm and utilize an Andon cord.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  An Andon cord is simply an emergency signal that requires all hands-on deck. Like swarming, the entirety of the team should focus on this goal and tackle it before it snowballs into a larger issue. Swarming was also used at the beginning of our development phase as we had to figure out our Google Auth situation before proceeding with the core app. In this case, we had two people developing, one person researching how to use the Google API, and me integrating the Google API into automation. By focusing on one large obstacle together, we were able to login using Google OAuth, something other teams weren’t even able to achieve halfway through the semester. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
  By using the Andon cord and swarming, we learned to collaborate under high-stress situations. This roadblock was intimidating at first as none of us knew how to use the Google API, but simply asking each other for help was all it took to succeed. Without judgement, we dropped our personal responsibilities to come together for a few hours and plan how to initiate this feature. Even if we didn’t have anything to contribute, we stayed on call for moral support. I think it is important to learn, especially in an introverted career such as computer science, that it is okay to ask for help. Having someone to rely on and support you, whether you fail or succeed, is really what drove us to victory this semester. Everything is a learning experience and asking for help should not be punishable!
</p>
<br>
<p id="subheader-subtitle"> how did you make your decision? how did stakeholders influence your project? </p>
<p>
  As this was a senior capstone project, all decisions were influenced by our primary stakeholder and professor. Previously mentioned, we had liberty to choose an app of our liking while following cloud-native principles. Each sprint we met with our professor, giving feedback of our time, and discussing if we met the requirements or not. He’d give remarks about how we should proceed, things we can improve on, and sometimes references to tutorials we could implement. Having our professor within our team Discord proved to be beneficial, as he was able to oversee every GitHub push or pull in real time.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Though, our professor was not our only stakeholder. We considered us students as the functioning stakeholders of Hawkstagram, so we wanted to reflect our needs in our version of Instagram. As stated, our team used A/B testing to settle on design choices and web flow. The feedback of our users aided in the prioritization of deliverables and our story points, which decided the urgency we must tackle the sprint goals. With each iteration, we relied on one another as teammates to conclude what items were realistic and achievable. This was not easy, considering our conflicting schedules and remote environment. We were forced to adapt, despite the chaos, in an efficient way that worked for all four of us!  
</p>
<br>
<p>
  However, some adaption cannot be dedicated to simple “trial and error”. Since we were following Mr. Smith’s DevOps textbook throughout the semester, we found it very insightful as we had never worked with DevSecOps-focused Agile methods before. Using his decades of experience, we skillfully applied methods such as the Andon cord and swarming. The textbook was largely corporate-focused, but seeing how these issues unfold in our small class setting made it seem like these situations are always inevitable! In the end, it was a surreal experience to present our project in front of the man who was the “Big Brother”. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Thank you to our professor Mr. Hajek and Mr. Smith for all their limitless knowledge and guidance. Most importantly, thank you to my team Andrew, Aleks and Maria! I have never had such a hardworking and driven team like this one; I’m so lucky to have met them in my last project in my undergraduate studies! Hawkstagram is an app made to build and foster new relationships during one’s academic journey, and I am so grateful to say it did that for me! Farewell, IIT!
