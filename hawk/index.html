<h3>AWS, DEVOPS, MARIADB, NODEJS, NGINX, PUG</h3>

<p> <span id="extraspan">M</span> y senior capstone project for the ITMT430 Systems Integration course. Using the comprehensive knowledge from all the classes taken previously, myself and my team built a three-tier web application called Hawkstagram - 
    an Instagram-inspired app for IIT students. On the frontend, we utilized NodeJS, PUG and Nginx to bring a web-based application for students at IIT to post and view others' photos. 
    As for the backend, we use MariaDB and AWS to store and retrieve our data. Additional features include Google single-sign-on API and full automation of deployment using Vagrant, Promox and Terraform on an Ubuntu server.
</p>

<p>
    Throughout this course, our team worked in three-week sprints over 16 weeks to accomplish a build of three web servers, one load balancer, and a database with a cloud-based architecture. As a cybersecurity feat,
    we also implemented restricted firewall access, as well as secrets and keys through Hashicorp vault. 
    We rotated roles of Project Manager, Lead Developer, UI/UX Developer, and IT Operations and Systems Manager to experience all types of labor in the value stream. 
    It was a challenging, yet fulfilling semester applying all my studies from my three years at IIT! Please visit the repository and documentation below!
