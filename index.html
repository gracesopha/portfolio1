<!-- ABOUT ME -->

<p> <span>T</span> hank you for taking the time to visit! My name is Grace Sopha, an IT Specialist with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology and Management, 
    based in Chicago. Ever since I was a little girl, I've always been curious of computers and technology. Stemming from a family of computer scientists, it was an advantageous feat for me.
    I often found myself sneaking into my dad's gear to fiddle with the latest gadgets and gizmos - only imagining I was a super-scientist engineering the next big device. To think that 20 years later I would become one!

<p> Well, maybe not a super-scientist, but you get the jist.
    In hindsight, I have dedicated most of my life to studying technology whether I knew it or not. However, throughout my formal education, I have explored a variety of tastes that IT has to offer. 
    This website serves as the hub for all of my thoughts regarding my work and projects! Once again, thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoy your stay!

<p> Maturing my career in technology, I have come to understand the necessity for <b>creative problem solving, consistent collaboration, and continuous learning</b> during the software development lifecycle. This premonition has come to me during my studies, 
    where I have worked on a plethora of projects that have allowed me to explore the different fields of technology. Though, I can say I dipped my toes in each pool, I still have so much more to learn!
    As always, I am happy to discuss my previous works, and potential future opportunities to evolve my dedication in creating a safer and resilient technology
    experience for all users. You can find all my information on my <a href="contact"> contact page</a>. While you're here, please take a look below at my prior projects and other work experience in fields such as 
    Coding Security, Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity and Defense, Data Science, DevSecOps, Full-Stack Web and Software Development, Project Management, UI/UX and much more!
