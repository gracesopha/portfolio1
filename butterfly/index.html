<h3>PYTHON, REACTJS, TYPESCRIPT</h3>

<p> <span>T</span> he summer of 2022 I had the pleasure of working on Scarlet Data Studio's Butterfly app as an intern software developer. 
    Butterfly is a social media app designed to meet new people in your community. Matches are made by like-interests, hobbies, and even name similiarities!
    Those of us at SDS were paired up weekly to test out the application regularly and chat with our peers.  
    Scarlet Data Studio is an organization of IIT alumni that provide students with an opportunity to experience the real world of software production. It was my first time as an intern 
    and although nervous, I learned so much! Coming into the program I had little to no experience with ReactJS and Typescript, but within the six weeks, I trained alongside 
    my mentor, Spriha, who guided me throughout the learning process. My role as a frontend software developer was to bring the blocked feature to user.
    This is an essential function as it provides users with safety and protection from any unwanted interactions, while still being able to use the core features.
