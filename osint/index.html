<h3>CYBERSECURITY, DATA ANALYSIS, DATA VISUALIZATION, PYTHON</h3>

<p> <span>T</span> he Cybersecurity Technologies final project's task was to have our group of eight create an open-source intelligence dashboard that 
    scrapes social media posts based on keywords for cybersecurity analysis. The two social media sites used for the dashboard are connected through the 
    Twitter and Reddit APIs, which can be chosen by the user through the GUI. Items associated with the keywords include: author id, tweet/body, date and time, id, device source, positive/negative score and so forth. 
    For our purposes, we used the keywords "Covid vaccine" for our research analysis.

    My role as the Project Manager was to plan, assign, quality test and scribe the entirety of the software's creation. Additionally, I was responsible for overseeing
    the developers' work and assigning tasks based on urgency, while determining risks and mitigations. The extensive proposal as well as the analysis of the findings can be located below. 
    Please visit the repository and follow the necessary instructions to try the dashboard yourself!
